# HitOrNot
This is a little project that I created for Social Media Managment, a subject that I studied at University Of Catania. I made a script that gives an opportunity to detect an artist that will be trend, with good possibilities, in all Spotify charts of the world.

I insert two html files where the content is in Italian language. In these files, I explain how to use the Spotify API analyzing different cases of prediction, I play with my extracted characteristics. There is also the file that explain how to use the hitornot.py for my predictions and the finality of this.

# Usage
Download hitornot.py and execute it with python 3.

# Attention
I use only 62 Spotify charts(isn't present the global chart) present in 2020-03-04, so the prediction is based only with that day.
