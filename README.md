# HitOrNot
This is a little project that I created for Social Media Managment, a subject that I studied at University Of Catania. I made a script that gives an opportunity to detect an artist that will be trend, with good possibilities, in all charts of the world.

# Usage
Download hitornot.py and execute it with python 3.

# Attention
I use only 62 charts(isn't present the global chart) present in 2020-03-04, so the prediction is based only with that day.
